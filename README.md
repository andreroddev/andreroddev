Software Engineer — .NET • Azure • SQL

I build backend systems that handle real operational complexity —
not just features, but the automation, diagnostics, and reliability that keep them running.

Most of my work lives between development and operations:
production debugging, failure analysis, data consistency,
and turning manual processes into reliable systems.
