Software Developer — .NET • Azure • SQL

I build backend systems that handle real operational complexity —
not just features, but the automation, diagnostics, and reliability that keep them running.

Most of my work lives between development and operations:
production debugging, failure analysis, data consistency,
and turning manual processes into reliable systems.

### Focus

Backend Engineering • Cloud Architecture • APIs • SQL Performance • Automation • Observability • Security • Reliability

---

### Stack

.NET • C# • ASP.NET Core • Azure Functions
SQL Server — design, tuning, procedures, versioning
Azure — App Service, Blob Storage, SQL, Pipelines
REST • SignalR • JWT • OAuth 2.0 • Swagger
CI/CD • Structured Logging • Monitoring

### Engineering

Operational thinking before implementation
Systems designed for how they break, not just how they work
Automation over repetition
Simple surface, resilient internals
Business problems first — technical decisions second

---

### Side Projects

I build complete products end-to-end:
Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
Real-time interaction systems
Business analytics & reporting tools
Automated content & technical SEO
