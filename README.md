**Software Developer** — .NET · Azure · Systems That Run
---
I build backend systems that handle real operational complexity — not just features, but the infrastructure, automation, and diagnostics that keep them running when no one is watching.
Most of my work lives between development and operations: production debugging, failure analysis, data consistency, and turning manual processes into reliable systems.
