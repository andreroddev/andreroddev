Software Developer — .NET • Azure • Systems That Run

I build backend systems that handle real operational complexity —
not just features, but the infrastructure, automation, and diagnostics
that keep them running when no one is watching.

Most of my work lives between development and operations:
production debugging, failure analysis, data consistency,
and turning manual processes into reliable systems.

Focus
Backend Engineering • Cloud Architecture • APIs • SQL Performance •
Automation • Observability • Security • Production Reliability

Stack
.NET • C# • ASP.NET Core • Azure Functions
SQL Server (design, tuning, procedures, versioning)
Azure (App Service, Blob Storage, SQL, Pipelines)
REST APIs • SignalR • JWT • OAuth 2.0
Stripe • MailKit • QuestPDF
CI/CD • Structured Logging • Rate Limiting

Engineering
Operational thinking before implementation
Systems designed for how they break, not just how they work
Automation over repetition
Simple surface, resilient internals
Business problems first — technical decisions second

Side Projects
I also build complete products end-to-end:
→ Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
→ Real-time interaction systems
→ Data-driven decision tools
→ Automated content & technical SEO

// I don't just ship code. I ship systems that survive Monday morning.
